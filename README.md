Extra functionalities:
1) adjust: volume, duration and select one from multiple instruments
2) record: after the record button is pressed, everything you played will be stored 
3) reset: the reset button will delete the recording you've made before
4) play: the play button lets you hear the melody you've played in an recording session
5) save: after finishing a recording session, the save button copies an automatically generated assembly code to your clipboard, which you can include in a new .asm file. In runtime the recorded melody will be played with the adjusted volume, duration and instrument
6) game: the game button colors your piano key buttons to a specific color, as a preparation for the mini-game
